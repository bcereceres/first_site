            <p>Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it laying around the house in his various favorite spots. Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks, but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off. He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.</p>
            <p>He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too. Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.</p>
